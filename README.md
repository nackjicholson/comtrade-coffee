# comtrade-coffee

> Sample usage of the comtrade UN database API

### Intro

This project is meant to be a small digestible example of how I might get started building a React/Redux application
from scratch. It is meant to show my comfort with that ecosystem, and usage of tools to help me build in that ecosystem
quickly. Much of the foundation of this app was generated with a yeoman generator that I use often when starting a new
project ([yo react-nack](https://github.com/nackjicholson/generator-react-nack).

The Application is a simple visualization based off of the [Comtrade UN Data API](http://comtrade.un.org/data/doc/api/).
It pulls information from that service about international coffee trade. So far it allows you to pick a country that
you're interested in and view a visualization which compares the USD to Kg weight of those trades during 2015.
